# RHS-Neural-Network
## A multi-classification problem using Convolutional Neural Networks

### Description
#### For this deep learning project, I decided to make use of my image dataset which I had collected from an earlier web scraping project. As a result of this, I created a CNN deep learning model which hoped to accurately classify the 3147 different types of plants I had managed to save from the [RHS database](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/Search-Results?form-mode=true&context=l%3Den%26q%3D%2523all%26sl%3DplantForm), however because of the large amount of possible plants I could classify, I decided to set the default number of classes to 50.
